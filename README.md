## Description 
This predictive model can classify Pokemon types based on traits they possess!
● Scraped data from ​https://www.pokemon.com/us/
● Gathered 27 features on 810 pokemon
● Engineered features from raw data that ended up being the most influential on model accuracy
● Compared evaluation metrics of 9 models to find top performer; KNN was most effective with K value of 1

## Python Tools:
   - Pandas
   - Beautifulsoup
   - Sklearn

## Future Applications
As one of many avid pokemone fans out there. This model can assist in detemining the type of each pokemon and help trainers all over the digital universe to be the very best. As the nintendo company keeps releaseing new pokemone with every generation, this model can also be used to predict the type of pokemon that will be released as Pokemon does try to keep a balance in their creations.
